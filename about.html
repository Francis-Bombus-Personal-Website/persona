			<h3>Hiking</h3>
			<img src="images/hiking.jpg" alt="Hiker">
			<p>Hiking is a way I found to start doing some physical activity, since it is a great form of exercise and
				can help me stay fit and healthy. Hiking often takes me to beautiful places with stunning views of
				nature, wheather it's mountains, lakes or the sea.</p>
			<p>It helps me clear my mind after a stressful day and it also can be challenging, specially if I'm tackling
				steep inclines or long distances. Overcoming those challenches and pushing myself to my limits can be
				incredibly rewarding.</p>
			<p>The connection with nature and environment is a way I find to scape the hustle and bustle of cuty life
				and get some peace and quiet in great outdoors. Is almost a mental health habit to reduce stress,
				anxiety and avoid depression.</p>

			<h3>Photography</h3>
			<img src="images/selfportrait.jpg" alt="Photographer">
			<p>Photography has allow me to express my creativity and capture the world in my own way. Is a way I find to
				share with my people how I see life itself. It helps me preserve memories and make perdure an instant,
				forever.</p>
			<p>While it can be technically challenging, finding new techniques and features with my camera is rewarding
				and fun. I also have great passion for traveling and that moment after a trip, when I seat at home and
				review the pictures I took and share it with my family, is magic. I also adore that moment because my
				kids share their pictures and we can all see diferent perspectives of one same experience.</p>
